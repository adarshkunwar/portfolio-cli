# Personal Portfolio.

## Tech stack used.

- React (HTML, JS)
- Tailwind (CSS)

## Main goal.

- My main goal with this portfolio is to show my skills. Both as a Web developer and as a aspiring writer.

## How to see it

- Once this is complete. I will put it under my own domain. Before that however to view the progress.

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adarshkunwar/portfolio-cli .
```

2. go into the newly created directory.

```bash
cd portfolio-cli
```

3. Move onto the respective branch that you want to see.

the write branch will mainly be used to showcase my ability as a writer. So, I will mainly focus on the text and how it looks.

The code branch will be used to showcase my ability as a coder. For this I am using my currently running passion of <strong> Linux </strong> as an inspiration.

```bash
git checkout code
```

4. Install all the necessary packages via npm

```bash
npm install
```

5. Run this on your local server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Be amazed by my <em> ===Glorious Creation=== </em>
